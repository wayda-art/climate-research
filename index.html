                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                <p>Climate change is a widely acknowledged phenomenon that poses significant challenges globally.
                    Despite
                    this recognition, the response to climate change mitigation has been deemed inadequate(1). The 2021
                    IPCC
                    Sixth Assessment report determined that human emissions of greenhouse gases have already increased
                    global temperatures by almost 1.1 degrees Celsius since the period 1850-1900. The report also
                    indicates
                    that there is over a 50% probability that global temperatures will rise to or exceed 1.5°C between
                    2021
                    and 2040(2). The impact to natural and human systems should warming continue to rise to 2 ◦C above
                    pre-industrial levels are expected to be catastrophic. This leaves a relatively narrow window for
                    the
                    transformative societal changes necessary to limit global warming to around 1.5°C(2).
                    While collective efforts by businesses, governments, and non-governmental organizations are
                    essential,
                    individual actions are key to moving away from the current 'business as usual' approach. This
                    transition
                    relies on individuals making significant and sustained reductions in their greenhouse gas
                    emissions(3).
                    This is because 65–72% of greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to individual actions related to
                    mobility, shelter, and food (4).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Given that individual actions account for a significant share of emissions, there are many ways for
                    individuals to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A study by Wynes and Nicholas (2017)
                    highlights several impactful actions to lower one's carbon footprint. Such actions include having
                    fewer
                    children, which can reduce emissions by an average of 58.6 tCO2e per year , living without a car,
                    which
                    can save 2.4 tCO2e per year, avoiding air travel, which can save 1.6 tCO2e per roundtrip
                    transatlantic
                    flight, and adopting a plant-based diet, which saves 0.8 tCO2e per year. Other moderate-impact
                    actions,
                    which save between 0.2 and 0.8 tCO2e per year, include using green energy and switching from
                    gasoline to
                    hybrid cars. Low-impact actions such as recycling and reusing materials, upgrading light bulbs, and
                    conserving water save less than 0.2 tCO2e per year(5). By adopting these initiatives an individual
                    could
                    reduce their carbon footprint by at least 20–37%(6).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Engaging youth in adopting and adapting to a low-carbon lifestyle is crucial for achieving the
                    greenhouse gas emission reduction targets necessary to mitigate the worst impacts of climate
                    change(7).
                    This is because the youth, comprising a significant portion of the global population, are expected
                    to be
                    most affected by the adverse outcomes of climate change in the coming decades(8). Moreover, they are
                    actively contributing to it through nearly every aspect of their lifestyles. In addition their
                    decisions
                    and lifestyle choices have longer-term consequences compared to older individuals, potentially
                    yielding
                    greater impacts toward meeting emissions reduction targets. Importantly, this developmental stage is
                    crucial for shaping behavioral habits—both pro- and counter-environmental(7).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, in the engagement of energy conservation behaviors Han et al. (2022) demonstrated that
                    having
                    awareness of climate change, understanding its causes and knowledge of specific action strategies
                    positively predict engagement in energy-conservation behaviors(9). Similarly, Pickering et al.,
                    (2021)
                    found that high school students who comprehend the causes of climate change and are aware of
                    specific
                    action strategies experience an increased sense of agency, leading to a higher likelihood of
                    participating in climate mitigation efforts(10).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, research by Dawson et al., (2022) found that in many countries climate change education is
                    primarily focused on learning about the science of climate change (11). This included learning about
                    issues, such as the carbon cycle, greenhouse gases, melting icecaps and feedback-loops (12).
                    However,
                    despite the importance of this knowledge, the lack of a science-based curriculum approach focusing
                    on
                    specific action strategies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions means that youths are not
                    prepared to become active, pro-environmental citizens. This indicate that research to better
                    understand
                    the knowledge of youths on effectiveness of individual actions in mitigating climate change are
                    important.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An on-line survey done by Pickering et al., (2021) among 17–18-year-old Canadian youths found out
                    that
                    while the majority of youth surveyed believe their actions and lifestyle decisions could help make a
                    difference. However, the level of confidence in how well their schooling had prepared them for CC
                    and
                    mitigation was not high. As a result, knowledge of youth on the efficacy of individual-level actions
                    that reduce GGE was low and that low-impact behaviors, particularly recycling, had their
                    significance is
                    over-estimated while the most impactful behaviour such as having one fewer child—was scored as the
                    least
                    effective at reducing GGE(10). The data for this study was collected through an online survey, which
                    may
                    limit the representativeness of the sample, as not all youth have access to the internet or may not
                    be
                    willing to participate in online surveys. Additionally, the study did not investigate factors that
                    shape
                    youth perceptions of their ability to reduce GGE through lifestyle choices. However, it did examine
                    the
                    relationship between demographic variables, such as age, gender, and school type, and knowledge of
                    GGE
                    reducing actions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Similar findings were obtained from a study by Andersson et al (2022) in Ireland involving an
                    on-line
                    survey among 500 youths (aged 16 to 24 years) on knowledge and beliefs about climate change
                    mitigation
                    revealed that there is a significant lack of understanding regarding the relative impact of various
                    pro-environmental behaviors. The findings indicated that a low proportion of youths could correctly
                    identify the environmental impact of different pro-environment behaviours and that their responses
                    indicated biases towards underestimating high-impact behaviours (especially eating a plant-based
                    diet)
                    and overestimating low-impact behaviours (in particular, recycling and not littering)(13).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From a study by Baldwin et al (2022) which involved an online survey involving 425 youths found that
                    although participants reported a high level of understanding of impacts of climate change, they had
                    significant knowledge gaps regarding the most effective measures to mitigate CC. In addition, youth
                    expressed little hope that society will take action, and only a small proportion of youth reported
                    to
                    believe in the effectiveness of their actions in addressing climate change. Significant gender and
                    age
                    differences were found for knowledge, experience, and concern about CC impacts, as well as
                    perceptions
                    of how well school had prepared them for navigating the impacts of CC(14).
                    Also, another study by Truelove and Parks (2012) among undergraduate students aged 18-25 years. The
                    study found that while individuals generally understand the climate impacts of personal vehicle use
                    accurately, there is a tendency to overestimate the environmental impacts of behaviors such as
                    littering
                    or using reusable grocery bags(15).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, these studies have shown that youth generally perceive their individual actions positively
                    in
                    terms of their potential to mitigate climate change. <b><i>However, the research also highlights a
                            lack
                            of
                            knowledge regarding the relative mitigative potential of different individual behaviours.
                            Specifically,
                            youth tend to overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact actions while underestimating the
                            impact of
                            high-impact actions. However, majority of studies in this topic reviewed have predominantly
                            focused on
                            youth from developed countries in the global North, highlighting a critical need to
                            investigate
                            the
                            perspectives and knowledge levels of youth in the global South.</i></b> Understanding how
                    youth
                    in diverse
                    socio-economic, cultural, and regional contexts perceive climate change is essential for developing
                    inclusive and effective global climate strategies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, available researches have looked into the variations in knowledge on effectiveness of
                    individual actions in mitigating climate change across different sociodemographic groups. However,
                    these
                    studies have not assessed how non-socio-demographic factors such as: personal experiences with
                    climate-related events, Involvement in Environmental Activities, Peer Influence, family influence
                    and
                    perceived risk of climate related events can affect both knowledge and perceptions on effectiveness
                    of
                    individual actions in mitigating climate change. Understanding these variations and influencing
                    factors
                    is crucial for developing targeted educational programs and policies. By identifying the specific
                    needs
                    and beliefs of different groups, interventions can be tailored to enhance awareness and motivate
                    effective climate action among all youth demographics. Furthermore, these studies have predominantly
                    focused on educated youths, especially those in high school and university, potentially leaving out
                    uneducated youth or those with limited education. which make up to 60% of the youth population in
                    the
                    Sub-Saharan Africa(16). Including this broader demographic is important because uneducated youth or
                    those with limited education may have different perspectives and levels of knowledge on
                    effectiveness of
                    individual actions in mitigating climate change. Understanding their views can help create more
                    inclusive and effective educational strategies, ensuring that climate change education reaches all
                    segments of the youth population and fosters collective action towards environmental sustainability.
                    Lastly, existing research often relies on online surveys, potentially excluding those unwilling to
                    participate in online surveys and a significant portion of youth in developing countries who lack
                    internet access, which make up 65% in developing countries(17).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to assess youths’ perceptions and knowledge on
                    effectiveness
                    of individual actions in mitigating climate change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The study sought to answer the following research questions: (1) Do youths believe that their
                    activities
                    or lifestyle choices can help to lessen climate change (2)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is the accuracy of knowledge among
                    youths regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in mitigating climate change? and
                    (3)
                    What factors do influence youth’s perceptions and knowledge on effectiveness of individual actions
                    in
                    mitigating climate change?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We hypothesised that majority of youths do believe in the effectiveness of individual actions in
                    mitigating climate change and youths tend to overestimate the impact of behaviors with lower
                    efficacy,
                    such as recycling and reducing waste. We also hypothesized that there would be significant
                    variations in
                    perceptions and knowledge among youths with different socio-demographic characteristics and among
                    that
                    having personal experiences with climate-related events, being involved in Environmental Activities,
                    Peer and family influence will affect youth’s perceptions and knowledge on effectiveness of
                    individual
                    actions in mitigating climate change.

                <p>In this study, we explored youth’s knowledge and their perception on the effectiveness of
                    individual
                    actions in mitigating climate change. We asked these research questions on whether youths
                    believe
                    that their activities or lifestyle choices can help to lessen climate change, what is the
                    accuracy
                    of knowledge among youths regarding the effectiveness of various individual actions in
                    mitigating
                    climate change and what factors do influence youth’s perceptions and knowledge on effectiveness
                    of
                    individual actions in mitigating climate change? </p>

                    We also determined whether perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in
                    mitigating climate change varied with gender, age groups, education level and area of residency.
                    The perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
                    no significant variation with gender (p = 0.191), age groups (p = 0.105) educational levels (p =
                    0.415 or area of residency (p= 0.16). We also determined if perceptions on effectiveness of
                    individual level actions in mitigating climate change varied with personal experiences with
                    climate-related events, Involvement in Environmental Activities, Peer and family influence. The
                    perceptions on effectiveness of individual level actions in mitigating climate change showed
                    significant variation with personal experiences with climate-related events (p = 0.017),

                    (p = 0.0012) but showed no significant variation with influence from peers and effect from

                    To address the second research question, participants were asked to rank six behaviors according
                    to their perceived effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assigning '1'
                    representing the highest impact and '6' the lowest. We hypothesized that these rankings would
                    differ from those determined by a study conducted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). Specifically, we
                    expected respondents to overestimate the effectiveness of the less impactful behaviors. We used
                    Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine if there are significant differences in how youth rank
                    the impact of various individual actions compared to established rankings by Wynes and Nicholas
                    (2017)(5). The test showed statistically significant differences between how youth participants
                    ranked certain behaviors compared to calculated rankings derived from Wynes and Nicholas (2017).
                    Youths rated "having one fewer child" (Z = -13.8, p < 0.001) and "eat a plant-based diet" (Z=-7.58,
                        p < 0.0001) as less impactful. In contrast, they perceived "recycling" (Z=-14.7, p < 0.0001) to
                        be more impactful than the calculated rankings. </p>

                            We also determined whether knowledge on the effectiveness of individual actions in
                            mitigating climate change was associated with select independent variables. To do this
                            we first calculated an ‘effectiveness knowledge score’ (EKS). This score was derived by
                            taking the absolute value of the difference between a respondent’s ranking of each
                            action and the ‘true’ rank from Wynes and Nicholas (2017), and then calculating the mean
                            of these differences for each respondent. A score of zero indicated perfect alignment
                            with the calculated ranks (indicating high knowledge), while a score of three indicated
                            the greatest disparity in ranks (indicating low knowledge).

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Regarding demographic factors, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                            significant variation with gender (p = 0.383) or age groups (p = 0.229). However,
                            significant differences were observed among educational levels (p = 0.04), with
                            participants having secondary and university education levels demonstrating lower EKS
                            (mean 1.61 and 1.52, respectively) compared to those with no education and primary
                            education levels, where the mean EKS was 2.3 and 1.9, respectively. This suggests that
                            individuals with higher educational attainment possess greater knowledge of the relative
                            effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions.

                        <p>
                            We also determined that the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant
                            variation among those with participation in different environmental activities (p=
                            0.015) where those who have participated in different environmental activities
                            demonstrated lower EKS (mean 1.42) compared those who had not participated in different
                            environmental activities (mean 1.77). This suggests that individuals with who
                            participate in different environmental activities possess greater knowledge of the
                            relative effectiveness of individual climate change mitigation actions. In addition, the
                            effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed significant variation among those with
                            personal experiences with climate-related events where those with personal experiences
                            with climate-related events had demonstrated lower EKS mean 1.268 p= 0.003) compared
                            those who had no personal experiences with climate-related events (mean 1.68 p= 0.438).
                            This suggests that individuals with personal experiences with climate-related events
                            possess greater knowledge of the relative effectiveness of individual climate change
                            mitigation actions. However, the effectiveness knowledge score (EKS) showed no
                            significant variation among among those who believed that they were at risk to climate
                            change related events (mean 1.87 p = 0.36) and those who perceived they were at no risk
                            (mean 1.92 p = 0.24).

                            We also performed a series of one-way ANOVAs tests to explore potential correlations
                            between different sources of information about climate change, as reported by
                            respondents and their effectiveness knowledge score (EKS). However, all tests resulted
                            in non-significant results (p > 0.05). This suggests that no statistically significant
                            associations were observed between any specific information source and participants' EKS
                            in this study.

                            Regarding beliefs about climate change mitigation, there was no notable difference in
                            EKS between individuals who do not believe their actions or lifestyle choices can
                            contribute to reducing climate change (mean EKS = 1.8049; n = 251) and those who do
                            believe (mean EKS = 1.792; n = 49 p = 0.89).

                    In our study, we explored youth’s knowledge and their perception on the effectiveness of
                    individual actions for mitigating climate change. First, we examined whether youth believe that
                    their individual actions can help to mitigate climate change. Second, we investigated the

                    climate change. Third we examined how accuracy of knowledge varied according to age groups,
                    gender, education levels. We conducted a quantitative, cross-sectional study with 300
                    participants from Dar es Salaam region.

                    Our findings showed that a majority (83.7%) expressed belief in the effectiveness of personal
                    actions in mitigating climate change, supporting our H1. This highlights a generally positive
                    attitude towards individual responsibility in environmental stewardship. These findings are in
                    line with research by Udas et al.,(2021) which has shown that youth express a felt
                    responsibility to act on climate change and reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Earth(18).
                    Recognizing the importance of individual empowerment and perceived influence among youth in
                    their environmental actions, these results substantial significance.

                    Many participants skeptical about the impact of individual actions highlighted external factors,
                    predominantly blaming corporations and large companies for environmental degradation. These
                    participants felt disillusioned believing that individual actions were insignificant in
                    comparison to industrial and systemic sources of pollution. This perspective highlights the
                    challenge of fostering attitudes of personal responsibility, particularly given the broader
                    environmental impacts of corporate practices. It underscores the need for targeted educational
                    strategies and policy interventions to empower individuals and promote collective action toward
                    sustainable environmental practices. Movements such as Friday for future founded by Greta
                    Thunberg and other Student’s activists have mobilized many youths to action, such as through
                    school ‘climate strikes’ (19). However, It remains to be determined if such awareness-raising
                    will translate into a belief of greater agency amongst youth over CC mitigation at the
                    individual level.

                    While the majority of youths believed in the efficacy of their actions and lifestyle choices in
                    combating climate change, we also evaluated their knowledge around the relative impact of
                    various behaviors. Our findings showed that behaviors with lower impact, such as recycling and
                    reducing waste, tend to be overestimated, while the most impactful behavior of choosing to have
                    one fewer child is underestimated, supporting our hypothesis (H2). Previous research among US
                    adults has similarly found discrepancies in estimating the savings of different activities
                    (Attari et al., 2010). The perceived effectiveness of recycling, highlighted in our study, could
                    be explained by the fact that this is a behavior where youth can exert significant agency,
                    contrasting with actions like sustainable food consumption that may require more resources and
                    autonomy within family environments. Therefore, it is not surprising that recycling ranked high
                    among actions perceived as impactful, possibly reinforced by frequent exposure to recycling bins
                    and programs at school and elsewhere on a daily basis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most impactful behaviour rated in our study—having one fewer child—was scored as the least
                    effective at reducing GGE. This can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, this perception
                    may stem from a lack of understanding among youth regarding the long-term and cumulative impact
                    of population growth on carbon emissions. Individuals may prioritize more immediate or visible
                    actions, such as recycling or energy-saving measures, which they perceive as directly
                    influencing environmental outcomes they can observe in their daily lives. Moreover, cultural and
                    societal norms often emphasize personal consumption choices over demographic factors like family
                    size when discussing climate change mitigation. Thus, conversations on climate change mitigation
                    should broaden to include discussions on the long-term implications of demographic factors like
                    family size on carbon emissions. This is because choosing to have one fewer child by a US
                    family, as noted by Wynes and Nicholas (2017), can achieve emissions reductions equivalent to
                    those made by 684 teenagers adopting lifelong comprehensive recycling habits (p3). The impact of
                    this choice is significant due to the cumulative reduction in emissions across future
                    generations, as highlighted in life cycle assessments by Murtaugh and Schlax (2009).

                <br>
                <p>
                    The findings of our study offer many groups of people (teachers, students, parents, policy
                    makers or any education practitioners) with a message that while youth generally believe in the
                    effectiveness of individual actions to mitigate climate change, there is a need for education
                    that accurately informs them about the relative impact of different behaviors to foster more
                    informed environmental stewardship. Therefore, prioritizing the integration of comprehensive
                    climate change education into school curricula is essential. Such education should encompass not
                    only the scientific aspects of climate change but also the effectiveness of diverse mitigation
                    actions. Finally, future research could be conducted by addressing some of the limitations of
                    the current study, by including a more geographically diverse sample, encompassing both urban
                    and rural areas, as well as different regions within Tanzania and other countries in the global
                    South. This approach would provide a more comprehensive understanding of youth perceptions and
                    behaviours across various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Additionally, comparative
                    studies between different regions and countries could highlight unique regional challenges and
                    opportunities for effective climate change education and policy interventions. We also recommend
                    incorporating mixed-methods approaches that combine surveys with qualitative interviews or focus
                    groups in order to get deeper insights into the factors influencing youth perceptions and
                    actions related to climate change.

                <p>We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study that enrolled 300 youths aged 15 to 24 years
                    from Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania from November 2019 to February 2020. Tanzania, an East
                    African country, is divided into 31 regions, with Dar es Salaam serving as its commercial
                    capital. Dar es Salaam region was purposely selected due to its diverse population and
                    accessibility, making it representative of urban youth in the region. Study participants were
                    recruited from their homes through door-to-door visits.

                <h2>Data Collection Procedures</h2>
                <p> Data collection involved the use of interviewer-administered questionnaires. The interviewers
                    explained the purpose of the study to interested youths and obtained their consent. For
                    participants under 18 years old, consent was obtained from both the youths and their parents or
                    guardians. The survey took approximately 10 minutes to complete.

                <p>
                    The primary data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire. Participants were
                    initially asked, "Do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices can help to lessen
                    climate change?" with a yes or no response option. Those who responded "no" were then asked,
                    "Why do you believe that your activities or lifestyle choices cannot help to lessen climate
                    change?" (open-ended response, no word limit). These qualitative responses were subsequently
                    compiled and summarized.

                    To assess knowledge of individual-level climate change mitigation behaviors, participants were
                    asked to rank six behaviors by their perceived ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GGE):
                    live car-free, have one fewer child, eat a plant-based diet, switch from an electric car to
                    car-free, recycle, and upgrade lightbulbs. These behaviors represent four high-impact, one
                    moderate-impact, and one low-impact actions, as calculated by Wynes and Nicholas (2017). The
                    order of presentation of behaviors was randomized, with a rank of one indicating the most
                    reduction in emissions and six the least reduction.

                    Basic demographic variables were also collected, including age, gender, level of education, and
                    type of curriculum. Sources of climate change information were determined using a
                    check-all-that-apply format with 11 response options.

                    statistical analysis. Summary statistics were used to describe the demographic characteristics
                    of the participants. Chi-squared tests were conducted to determine if responder status (yes or
                    no) was associated with demographic variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare
                    the rankings of GGE-reducing behaviors provided by participants with those calculated by Wynes
